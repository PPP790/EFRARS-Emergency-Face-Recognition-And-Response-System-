# EFRARS-Emergency-Face-Recognition-And-Response-System-
An automated emergency system that uses real-time face recognition (Python, Flask, OpenCV) to track personnel during evacuations. It provides a live dashboard showing who is safe versus unaccounted for and sends a final list via SMS alert to rescue teams, significantly improving response time and safety.
